        Kelisto is a price comparison site for car insurance, energy, finances and communications. 
        They have a first-class in-house development team but they needed extra help to build new products and 
        evolve the ones they already had while keeping up with their impressive growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        We teamed up with them to build the Energy price comparator from scratch as well as other projects during several months.

      <p>
        Back in 2013 we attended the LAUNCH Hackathon in San Francisco, where we decided to create something with WebRTC (a brand new technology back then). WebRTC enables p2p 
        videoconference in the browser without the need of external plugins. We build a platform to practice languages with native speakers for free and
        right in your browser. With that project we won the second prize of the hackathon â€“ it was just an experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2014 we spent 4 weeks to make a real product out ouf that experiment and TLKR was born. It's still under heavy development, but you can already sign up and 
        start practicing your favourite language.
