[Hello Ember](http://dev.ghost.org/hello-ember/)The team behind the blogging platform 
[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) has decided to build the next iteration of their admin UI with 
[Ember.](http://emberjs.com/) In this article they share some of the reasons behind that decision. For those of you who don't know Ember, it's a MVC JavaScript framework with some similarities to Ruby on Rails, actually one of their core team members, 
[Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/), is also member of the Rails core team.[EmberJS with a Separate Rails API](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/emberjs-with-a-separate-rails-api)More about Ember.

[Testing at Airbnb](http://nerds.airbnb.com/testing-at-airbnb/)One of the things I love about Airbnb is their engineering team blog.
