excerpt: Some lessons we learned developing our own product
---

Recently, we took a 4 week hiatus in our consultancy work and decided to spent some time bringing to life an idea. It felt great to work together and be the owners of our product, and it was a great opportunity to learn the ins and outs of building something from the ground.  

While we missed some aspects of the product development on purpose due to the scope we set for our project, there certainly were some other things we completely missed or mistake. The good thing is that we were able to identify some flaws in our approach and learn a lot during the journey. After some analysis I came up with some lessons that we will for sure be applying in the next projects. 

Without further ado, I present you the 6 recommendations you must really consider when you decide to create your next *big thing*.


## 1. You must not leave behind the User Experience

We were a small team with limited resources and a very tight deadline. It was really easy to overlook the importance of **User Experience** in this context. But after some time we realized there are a lot of questions that need to be answered when developing a product. For every screen, every interaction you should previously have answered some questions: 

 
* What problem I'm solving here?  
* Is my solution good enough?  
* Who is the user?  
* What action do we want the user to take?  

And so on.

We all heard about the **Minimum Loveable Product** trend and how it emphasises that great products are those that instantly get the love!  
In this world of fierce competition, providing a great experience to our users is the only way to stand out. Does this mean beautiful and good looking design? Not necessarily
> No. Good User Experience is not about beautiful design  

So it boils down to providing an outstanding experience for our users. Truth is, users don't care about you or your product, they care about themselves and how they can use your product to their benefit. If the product solves their problem and it is a pleasure to use, then they will **love it**.

## 2. Measure. Assumptions must be validated

You heard it before. Analytics, metrics, data-driven. Are they buzzwords? No, they are not.  
It is crucial to define metrics as soon as possible when designing your product as they will help you validate your assumptions.  

We designed a finder page where users could search for other users based on certain criteria (language, location or interests). We made a lot of assumptions here: for example we assumed that location was important, that users would want to find other people based on their location. Sounds reasonable.
But you will never know if this is true unless you track the users and measure wether they are using the location search or not.  

Measuring this particular area can lead to decisions that directly affect your business.  
For example, let's say the usage turns out to be overwhelmingly high and your users are mainly interested in finding by location. Then with this information you could focus on improving the experience, for example, by allowing your users to display results in a map or other improvements for filtering the results. This could potentially lead to higher conversion rates and therefore, more traction for your product. Succeed!

And of course, if no one is interested in that feature, you move on!

## 3. Keep it simple and focus

It's easy to get carried away and picture your product as a full featured awesome product with millions of users and TV commercials and stuff..

But it is unrealistic to think that way, it is wiser to choose some basic core functionality and set a high quality standard for those basic features.

Think about what would be the main functionality that provides value for your users and then work on and around that. Focus on providing a high quality experience for that functionality and try to keep things as simple as possible for your first users. Once you get that initial traction and validation from your first users then you can start making new assumptions and providing more value with new features.

We tend to think that nobody will use our product unless it's packed with features but this is false and there are tons of examples out there.

## 4. Don't forget distribution

Also known as **Growth**.  
If you focus too much on your product and your users then you are probably missing something HUGE.
> How does my users get to my product?

Maybe you got everything right and your product is awesome but if you fail at distribution your product will, most probably, fail.

You have to think about distribution since day one. There are hundreds of ways to distribute your product, some are really simple, some are sophisticated, some are free, some involve investing money.
The important thing here is knowing your users and try to find out what would work best. Probably you are going to run a lot of failed experiments, but it is good to discard low performance distribution channels as soon as possible.

Another reason to think about distribution in the early days of your product is that it sometimes lead to strategic decisions regarding your product. For example, social networks such as Linkedin or Twitter (to name a few) rely heavily on virality and users creating their own network of contacts, which clearly is a key feature of their products.

## 5. Set goals and stick to them

Setting goals for everything you do will help you get better results. Besides the main goals you set for your product you have to think in terms of "goals" for every screen you design.
When you are working on a particular screen or user interaction, think about the purpose of it and ask what are you doing to accomplish that purpose and if the whole experience is pushing the user into that goal.

Usually when we start designing something we forget about the intended goal and come up with a few more goals that we expect the user to accomplish. This leads to chaotic layouts and interfaces that confuse the user and lower the quality of the user experience.

So, whenever you are designing a section or part of your product have in mind what's the purpose of it in this particular iteration. And make it work! Learn to say no and stick to your initial goals. Once you got those right you can move one to more ambitious objectives.

## 6. User testing and research

There is **nothing** more insightful than watching your own users interact with your product. This can be done by capturing their behaviour with analytics. However what's more effective than that is actually having the opportunity to observe what they do and let them explain why they do it.

There are services where you can hire users to test your web app, mobile app or prototype, and what they do is interact with the app while at the same time they talk you into everything that comes to their mind at all times. This is incredibly useful to realize that sometimes, what you may find obvious or logic, it isn't.

In-depth user testing is usually a complex process which consumes a lot of resources and probably most of the products at an early stage can't afford it. But user testing and research can also be done at a low budget and really bring great results. 

If resources are scarce, do not give in! Use [Guerrilla User Testing](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/guerrilla-testing.html) :)

The list of recommendations could go on forever as there are endless aspects to think about when creating a successful product but hopefully this sort summary can give you some directions towards building awesome products!
